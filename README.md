What is a README File?
In simple words, we can describe a README file as a guide that gives users a detailed description of a project you have worked on.

It can also be described as documentation with guidelines on how to use a project. Usually it will have instructions on how to install and run the project.

It is essential for you as a developer to know how to document your project by writing a README because:

It is the first file a person will see when they encounter your project, so it should be fairly brief but detailed.
It will make your project standout from a bunch of others. Also be sure your project is good too.
It will help you focus on what your project needs to deliver and how.
